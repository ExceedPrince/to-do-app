# to-do-app

This was a team project in CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.
This one of first big projects which had to be created by React. In this project I had a new team, and the communication was a little hard between the teammates, this is reason why was this project so hard for me. My job was being the leader of the team, declaring the schedule of this project, time management, debuging, and of course, writing some code.

It is possible to darg cards of the boards to another place, it was clearly my job without any third-party library. Right now this is the most what I can do with drag and drop.

The design was not my idea, the other part what I made is the dashboards should work differently. Sometimes they copied each other cards, the changed the size of their heights together, and their headers shared the same color. So separating their functionality was my job.

As I mentioned, this project was made with React.
